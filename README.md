# Containerized test execution of API automation 

ðŸš€ A repository for API testing using pytest framework

This repository contains an end-to-end automation framework for the containerized test execution of API automation using PyTest.

### Objective

The solution is designed to address the following objectives;

1.	To implement the generic API automation framework that can be reused for any type of API automation.
2.	To implement the containerized test execution that download and runnable with minimal efforts required to set up and execute.

### Pre-requisites

1. You need to have docker installed on your machine
2. OS: MacOS or Linux

## Steps to execute

### Checkout a GIT repository

In order to run a containerised test execution on your local machine, you need to download/clone this Git repository onto your local machine.

```bash
git clone rdhananjay7/pytestapitesting
```

Move to the project home directory

```
$ cd /Users/rdhananjay7/python-projects/api-testing
$ ls -ltr

```

### Build a Docker image

```bash
docker build -t sbdbapitests .
```

### Execute tests inside a Container

```bash
./bin/run_docker.sh
```

### Test Report 

Test Reports are available on host machine under /reports directory

```
$ pwd
/Users/rdhananjay7/python-projects/api-testing
$ cd report
$ ls -ltr

$ 
```

## Approach: 

In this approach;

1. We build a docker image, run a container on the fly and then run the tests in this container 
2. Build a docker image that has the latest python version
3. Copy or mount the test code onto this container
4. Install the requirements
5. Run a runner script that exports the required environment variables (credentials etc.) and then runs the tests inside a container
6. Report is saved to the mounted directory.
7. Running container is removed

### Framework Components:

1.	Logging
2.	Reporting
3.	Runner Scripts, to run the tests and to clean up the logs
4.	Command line support for parameterizing the run
5.	Properties file to set up the environment variables that can be sourced while running a runner script
